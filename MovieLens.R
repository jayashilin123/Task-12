# Recommendation systems help people make better choice depending on their tastes and needs. User 
# ratings are one character which recommendation system follows to recommend choices to the customer. 
# Highly rated and in-demand items are found with help of algorithm for recommending the products. 
# Also depending on the past behaviourof the user an alogrithm can recommend relevant and 
# user-specific items. It helps the user to select the most suitable item from the available options. 
# A happy customer is expected to return to shop frequently and this helps build business.

# Number of ratings available is important that a larger number gives a more reliable rating. The 
# average of large number of ratings will be more reliable than one person rating a movie too high or 
# too low. One user rating a bad movie too high will spoil the power to predict the movie ratings.
# So the number of ratings needs to be taken care.

# Movie recommendation system here uses User Id, Movie Id, Genres and the Movie rating. 
# Here every user does not rate every movie. So all the user, movie and genre specific effects on 
# rating is used as predictors in movie recommendations. 

# In movie recommendation the user effect, movie effect and genre effect are incorporated in the 
# algorithm so that we expect the algorithm to predict the ratings of all the movies based on the 
# available ratings along with the biases for the user behaviour, individual movies and the genres.

# Mean movie rating
mu <- mean(edx$rating)

# Create a function to calculate the RMSE to help model evaluation
RMSE <- function(true_ratings, predicted_ratings){
     sqrt(mean((true_ratings - predicted_ratings)^2))
}

# Load the validation dataset for evaluating the prediction accuracy
load("rdas/validation.rda")

# Here the mean rating across all movies and users, most naive figure is used as the predicted rating.
# Calculate the RMSE for the naive model used for prediction.
naive_rmse <- RMSE(validation$rating, mu)

# Tabulate the RMSE for the model
rmse_results <- data_frame(method = "Just the average", RMSE = naive_rmse)

# As expected this model didn't do well and error value is unacceptable.
# Different users rates same movie very differently depending on their tastes. Also some movies are 
# rated more often. Same difference are expected in different genre of movies.
# This generates a user specific, movie specific and genre specific effect when the ratings are done.
# We need to account for these difference in modeling so that the model accounts for the differences
# when different users rate same movies, or high ratings received for blockbuster movies or a similar 
# kind of bias in genres.

# Noticed that some of the top and low rated movies have few have rated only once.
# It is rather not a good idea to create a model when movies are predicted based on very few number 
# of ratings. So we try regularization by introducing the parameter 'lambda'. Lambda penalise 
# the values coming from small sample sizes. When n is large the value of lambda is effectively ignored.
# When value of n is small the values are shrunken towards zero. When lamda is large penality is
# more.
# The best value of lambda is the value which gives the prediction of minimum RMSE.

# Prediction with regularisation
# Series of lambda values are used.
# Regularisation factor lambda is introduced to userid, movieid and genres. Small estimates in these 
# variables will be penalised.
# With the help of a function the predictions are done for a series of lambda values and RMSE for 
# those predictions are found out.
